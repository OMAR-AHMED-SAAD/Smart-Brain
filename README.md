# Smart Brain Project 

Welcome to the Smart Brain project! This full-stack web application allows users to submit a URL of an image, and it uses the Clarifai API to detect faces in the image or identify celebrities and their faces. The project consists of a React frontend, an Express.js backend, and a PostgreSQL database. The frontend is hosted on Vercel, while the backend and database are hosted on Render.com.

## Project Structure

- **Frontend**: The frontend of the Smart Brain project is built using React. It handles user interactions and communicates with the backend to perform face detection and celebrity recognition.

- **Backend**: The backend of the Smart Brain project is built using Express.js. It handles API requests from the frontend, interacts with the PostgreSQL database, and communicates with the Clarifai API for image analysis.

- **Database**: The project uses a PostgreSQL database to store user information and image data.

- **API Integration**: The Smart Brain project integrates with the Clarifai API to perform image analysis. We've obtained an API key from Clarifai and set it as an environment variable in the backend.

## Deployment
The Smart Brain project is hosted on the following platforms:

- **Frontend**: Vercel
- **Backend and Database**: Render.com
